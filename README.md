# NFSU2 Trax Renamer
NFSU2 Trax Renamer is a script mod which can change the names of EA Trax songs without HEX editing the .exe file manually.
It has these options for each song:
+ Title (If you want to see brackets in names like vanilla, place them twice.)
+ Artist
+ Album
+ PlayIn (Available options are FE, IG and AL. It's used to choose default setting for the new save games.)
